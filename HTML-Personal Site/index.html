    <li>The Nike MAG is a limited-edition shoe created by Nike Inc. It is a replica of a shoe featured in the film Back to the Future Part II. The Nike Mag was originally released for sale in 2011 and again in 2016. Both launches were in limited
      quantities. The 2011 release was limited to 1,510 pairs, while the 2016 release was limited to 89 pairs.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul><strong><em><a href="https://stockx.com/nike-sb-dunk-low-london">Nike SB Dunk Low London</a></em></strong>
    <li>As part of the 2004 White City Dunk Series, the Nike SB Dunk Low London was released exclusively to London in limited numbers. Only 202 pairs were produced, causing all SB fans who didn’t have access to head straight to the resale market for
      a chance to own a pair.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul><strong><em><a href="https://stockx.com/nike-dunk-sb-low-paris">Nike Dunk SB Low Paris</a></em></strong>
    <li>These Dunks give new meaning to the term “rare.” During the White Dunk: Evolution of an Icon art event in Paris, a limited 202 pairs of Paris Dunks were released- each one being unique. The featured artwork of French painter Bernard Buffet
      was applied to the canvas that Nike cut out for the overlays of each shoe.</li>
